# FakePictureBypass
FakePictureBypass is a tweak that bypasses FakePicture's photo selector lock if you don't have a license.

**A deb build for this is currently unavailable as I still haven't finished making it yet.** However, using Filza you can do it manually, a tutorial will be described [here](/Manual.md).
